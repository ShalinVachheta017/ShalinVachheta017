## Projects

### [Event Prediction Model](https://github.com/ShalinVachheta017/ML_Project)
- **Description**: Conducted research on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), and Encoder-Decoder architectures to predict temperature and sunspot activity. Modeled three time series-based event predictions using diverse datasets, including custom datasets for generating event prediction models. Performed data preprocessing and normalization to optimize the training process and enhance model performance. Currently fine-tuning the model to improve its predictive accuracy and robustness across different datasets.

### Image Denoising Project
- **Description**: Applied Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise to create noisy image datasets, including the Data Science 2018 dataset with over 30,000 images. Implemented traditional noise reduction techniques such as Wiener and BM3D filters to establish a performance baseline. Developed and trained deep learning models to effectively denoise images, achieving comparable accuracy to non-deep learning methods. Enhanced model performance through custom preprocessing steps, significantly improving Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics.

### Vehicle Sales Data Analysis
- **Description**: Conducted detailed analysis of vehicle sales data, uncovering key trends and performance metrics. Processed and cleaned a dataset of 10,000+ vehicle sales records; created 20+ visualizations to effectively present findings. Identified a 30% sales peak in July and a 20% dip in December, and revealed that the North Region led sales with 38% of total transactions. Determined that SUVs were the most popular vehicle type, comprising 45% of sales.

### IPL Data Analysis
- **Description**: Explored and visualized Indian Premier League (IPL) data to uncover trends in team performance and player statistics. Processed and cleaned over 5,000 rows of IPL match and player data; provided actionable insights for team strategies. Identified that the top 3 teams won over 60% of their matches, with the leading team achieving a 68% win rate. Analyzed player performance, finding the top scorer averaged 55 runs per match and revealed that winning the toss increased match win probability by 15%.
